Css selectors------------

1.Simple selectors-
.class
#id
p element
* Universal

2.Grouping Css-
div,p,span

3.Attribute selectors-
Element[Attribute="value"]
Element[Attribute^="value"]//starts with
Element[Attribute$="value"]//ends with
Element[Attribute*="value"]//multiple characters before

4.Css Combinators-
div p//all p inside div
div>p//children(p) of div
div+p//immediate sibling(p) of div
div~p//general siblings after of div

5.Pseudo class selectors---
Link classes-
a:link//never visited before//a normal, unvisited link
a:visited//Already visited in current browser// a link the user has visited
a:hover
a:focus//when user tabbed on element like button get focus on first time but not same on link
a:active//when clicked on any element we get glance//a link the moment it is clicked

When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:

a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
a:active MUST come after a:hover

Input classes-
.class:focus//when clicked we get long focus.
.class:required//when required keyword is there it applies
.class:checked//when checkbox is checked it applies
.class:disabled//when disabled keyword is there it is applied

Position classes--
p:first-child//p is first child in parent container//Must at top of all children
q:last-child//q is last child in parent container//Must at bottom of all children
p:nth-child()//
The difference between :first-child and :first-of-type is that :first-of-type will match the first element 
of its element type, which in HTML is represented by its tag name, even if that element is not the first 
child of the parent. 
p:first-of-type//p is first of type itself in group of siblings may same or different
p:last-of-type//p is last of type itself in group of siblings may same or different

6.Pseudo element selectors---
.class::before//used to place content before element
.class::after//used to place content after element
.class::selection//when selects text get applied
  ::selection//for whole text
.class::first-letter//for first letter of text
.class::first-line//for first line of text
::marker//for list items in front of them
